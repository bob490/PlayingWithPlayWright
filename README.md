# PlaywrightLang - a scripting language for theatre kids
## Playwright is a work-in-progress A Level EPQ project. Updates are frequent, but don't expect too much!  
# Goals:
## 1: Create an embeddable scripting language (in the same vein as Lua)
## 2: Showcase it in a game context
## 3: Have its syntax be as human-readable and close to a real play script as possible
